poison-heal,"If this Pokémon is poisoned, it will heal for 1/8 of its maximum HP after each turn rather than taking damage.  This includes bad poison."
ice-body,"This Pokémon heals for 1/16 of its maximum HP after each turn during hail, and it does not take hail damage regardless of type."
fur-coat,Halves damage from physical attacks.
insomnia,"This Pokémon cannot be asleep.  This causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.  This ability functions identically to vital spirit in battle."
flame-body,"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being burned.  Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its hatch counter decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each step cycle, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.  This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or magma armor."
sticky-hold,"This Pokémon's hold item cannot be removed by other Pokémon.  Damaging moves that would remove this Pokémon's item can still inflict damage against this Pokémon, e.g. knock off or pluck.  This Pokémon can still use moves that involve the loss of its own item, e.g. fling or trick.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the encounter rate while fishing is increased."
strong-jaw,Strengthens biting moves to 1.5× their power.
air-lock,"While this Pokémon is in battle, weather can still be in play, but will not have any of its effects.  This ability functions identically to cloud nine."

fluffy,Damage from contact moves is halved.  Damage from Fire moves is doubled.
toxic-boost,This Pokémon has 1.5× its Attack when poisoned.

dauntless-shield,Boosts the Pokémon’s Defense stat when the Pokémon enters a battle.
sand-veil,"During a sandstorm, this Pokémon has 1.25× its evasion, and it does not take sandstorm damage regardless of type.  The evasion bonus does not count as a stat modifier.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm."
white-smoke,"This Pokémon cannot have its stats lowered by other Pokémon.  This ability does not prevent any stat losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Speed cut from paralysis; nor self-inflicted stat drops, such as the Special Attack drop from overheat; nor opponent-triggered stat boosts, such as the Attack boost from swagger.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative stat modifiers through guard swap, heart swap, or power swap.  This ability functions identically to clear body in battle.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved."
wonder-guard,"This Pokémon is immune to damaging moves that are not super effective against it.  Moves that inflict fixed damage, such as night shade or seismic toss, are considered super effective if their types are.  Damage not directly dealt by moves, such as damage from weather, a status ailment, or spikes, is not prevented.  This ability cannot be copied with role play or traded away with skill swap, but it can be copied with trace, disabled with gastro acid, or changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon can still use Role Play itself to lose this ability, but not Skill Swap.  If this Pokémon has a substitute, this ability will block moves as usual and any moves not blocked will react to the Substitute as usual."
flash-fire,"This Pokémon is immune to fire-type moves.  Once this Pokémon has been hit by a Fire move, its own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× as much damage until it leaves battle.  This ability has no effect while the Pokémon is frozen.  The Fire damage bonus is retained even if the Pokémon is frozen and thawed or the ability is lost or disabled.  Fire moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.  This ability takes effect even on non-damaging moves, i.e. will o wisp."
storm-drain,"All other Pokémon's single-target water-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon, if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Water moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.  If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability."
honey-gather,"This Pokémon has a chance of picking up honey after each battle.  This chance starts at 5% and rises another 5% after every tenth level: 5% from level 1–10, 10% from 11–20, and so on, up to 50% from 91–100.  This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off."
vital-spirit,"This Pokémon cannot be asleep.  This causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.  This ability functions identically to insomnia in battle.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased."

zen-mode,"This Pokémon switches between Standard Mode and Zen Mode after each turn depending on its HP.  Below 50% of its maximum HP, it switches to Zen Mode, and at 50% or above, it switches to Standard Mode.  This Pokémon returns to Standard Mode upon leaving battle or losing this ability.  This ability has no effect if this Pokémon is not a darmanitan."
libero,Changes the Pokémon’s type to the type of the move it’s about to use.
dry-skin,"This Pokémon takes 1/8 of its maximum HP in damage after each turn during strong sunlight, but it heals for 1/8 of its HP each turn during rain.  This Pokémon takes 1.25× as much damage from fire-type moves, but whenever a water move hits it, it heals for 1/4 its maximum HP instead."
regenerator,This Pokémon regains 1/3 of its maximum HP when it is switched out for another Pokémon under any circumstances other than having fainted.  This ability does not take effect when a battle ends.
friend-guard,All friendly Pokémon take 0.75× as much direct damage from moves while this Pokémon is in battle.  This effect stacks if multiple allied Pokémon have it.
steam-engine,Boosts the Pokémon’s Speed stat drastically if hit by a Fire- or Water-type move.

dark-aura,Strengthens dark moves for all friendly and opposing Pokémon.
grassy-surge,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it changes the terrain to grassy terrain."
soundproof,"This Pokémon is immune to moves flagged as being sound-based.  heal bell is unaffected.  uproar still prevents this Pokémon from sleeping.  This Pokémon can still receive a Perish Song counter through baton pass, and will retain a Perish Song counter if it acquires this ability after Perish Song is used.  howl, roar of time, sonic boom, and yawn are not flagged as sound-based."
leaf-guard,"This Pokémon cannot be given a major status ailment during strong sunlight.  This ability does not heal prior status ailments.  rest will fail altogether with this ability in effect.  yawn will immediately fail if used on this Pokémon during strong sunlight, and an already-used Yawn will fail if the weather turns to strong sunlight in the meantime."
forecast,"During rain, strong sunlight, or hail, this Pokémon's type changes to water, fire, or ice, respectively, and its form changes to match.  This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than castform.  If the weather ends or becomes anything that does not trigger this ability, or a Pokémon with air lock or cloud nine enters battle, this Pokémon's type and form revert to their default.  If this ability is lost or disabled, this Pokémon cannot change its current type and form until it regains its ability."
shadow-tag,"While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.  Other Pokémon with this ability are unaffected.  Pokémon with run away can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item."
dazzling,"When an opposing Pokémon attempts to use a move that targets this Pokémon or an ally, and that move has priority, it will fail."
oblivious,"This Pokémon cannot be infatuated and is immune to captivate.  If a Pokémon is infatuated and acquires this ability, its infatuation is cleared."

overcoat,This Pokémon does not take damage from weather.
hustle,"This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5× as much regular damage, but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.  Special moves are unaffected.  Moves that do set damage, such as seismic toss, have their accuracy affected, but not their damage.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased."
sturdy,"When this Pokémon is at full HP, any hit that would knock it out will instead leave it with 1 HP.  Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold.  If this Pokémon is holding a focus sash, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed."
grass-pelt,Boosts Defense while grassy terrain is in effect.
psychic-surge,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it changes the terrain to psychic terrain."
illuminate,"Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled.  This ability has no effect in battle."
normalize,"This Pokémon's moves all act as if they were normal-type.  Moves that inflict typeless damage do so as usual.  Moves of variable type, such as hidden power, are affected.  They otherwise work as usual, however; weather ball, for example, is always forced to be Normal, but it still has doubled power and looks different during weather.  As thunder wave is prevented by immunities, unlike most non-damaging moves, it does not affect ghost-type Pokémon under the effect of this ability."
long-reach,A move used by this Pokémon will not make contact.
chlorophyll,This Pokémon's Speed is doubled during strong sunlight.  This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.
super-luck,This Pokémon's moves have critical hit rates one stage higher than normal.

telepathy,"This Pokémon does not take damage from friendly Pokémon's moves, including single-target moves aimed at it."
arena-trap,"While this Pokémon is in battle, opposing Pokémon cannot flee or switch out.  flying-type Pokémon and Pokémon in the air, e.g. due to levitate or magnet rise, are unaffected.  Pokémon with run away can still flee.  Pokémon can still switch out with the use of a move or item.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is doubled."
unnerve,Opposing Pokémon cannot eat held Berries while this Pokémon is in battle.  Affected Pokémon can still use bug bite or pluck to eat a target's Berry.
technician,"This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× their power if their base power is 60 or less.  This includes moves of variable power, such as hidden power and magnitude, when their power is 60 or less.  helping hand's power boost is taken into account for any move, as is defense curl's power boost for rollout."
cloud-nine,"While this Pokémon is in battle, weather can still be in play, but will not have any of its effects.  This ability functions identically to air lock."
stall,"This Pokémon moves last within its priority bracket.  Multiple Pokémon with this ability move in order of Speed amongst themselves.  The full incense and lagging tail take precedence over this ability; that is, Pokémon with these items move after Pokémon with this ability.  Pokémon with both this ability and one of these items are delayed as much as if they had only the item.  This ability works as usual during trick room: Pokémon with this ability will move in reverse order of Speed after Pokémon without it."
grim-neigh,"When the Pokémon knocks out a target, it utters a terrifying neigh, which boosts its Sp. Atk stat."
electric-surge,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it changes the terrain to electric terrain."
shields-down,"When this Pokémon enters battle and at the end of each turn, if its HP is 50% or above, it changes into Meteor Form; otherwise, it changes into Core Form.  In Meteor Form, it cannot be given a major status ailment (though existing ones are not cured), cannot become drowsy from yawn, and cannot use rest (which will simply fail).  This ability cannot be copied, replaced, or nullified.  This ability only takes effect for Minior."
marvel-scale,"Whenever this Pokémon has a major status ailment, it has 1.5× its Defense.  This bonus does not count as a stat modifier."
turboblaze,"This Pokémon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.  For example, this Pokémon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.  When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.  This ability functions identically to mold breaker and teravolt."
gale-wings,Raises flying moves' priority by one stage.
stalwart,Ignores the effects of opposing Pokémon’s Abilities and moves that draw in moves.
rock-head,This Pokémon does not receive recoil damage from its recoil moves.  struggle's recoil is unaffected.  This ability does not prevent crash damage from missing with jump kick or high jump kick.
illusion,"This Pokémon, upon being sent out, appears to have the species, nickname, and Poké Ball of the last Pokémon in the party that is able to battle.  This illusion breaks upon being hit by a damaging move.  Other damage, e.g. from weather or spikes, does not break the illusion, nor does damage done to a substitute.  If the party order becomes temporarily shuffled around as Pokémon are switched out in battle, this ability chooses the last Pokémon according to that shuffled order."
dragons-maw,Powers up Dragon-type moves.
tinted-lens,This Pokémon deals twice as much damage with moves that are not very effective against the target.
chilling-neigh,"When the Pokémon knocks out a target, it utters a chilling neigh, which boosts its Attack stat."

propeller-tail,Ignores the effects of opposing Pokémon’s Abilities and moves that draw in moves.

speed-boost,This Pokémon's Speed rises one stage after each turn.
flower-veil,Protects friendly grass Pokémon from having their stats lowered by other Pokémon.
shield-dust,"This Pokémon is immune to the extra effects of moves used against it.  An extra effect is a move's chance, listed as an ""effect chance"", to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect.  For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate."
bulletproof,"Protects against bullet, ball, and bomb-based moves."
damp,"While this Pokémon is in battle, self destruct and explosion will fail and aftermath will not take effect."
gooey,Lowers attacking Pokémon's Speed by one stage on contact.
aura-break,"While this Pokémon is on the field, dark aura and fairy aura weaken moves of their respective types to 2/3 their power, rather than strengthening them."
anticipation,"When this Pokémon enters battle, if one of its opponents has a move that is super effective against it, self destruct, explosion, or a one-hit knockout move, all participating trainers are notified.  The move itself is not revealed; only that there is such a move.  Moves that inflict typeless damage, such as future sight, and moves of variable type, such as hidden power, count as their listed types.  counter, metal burst, mirror coat, and one-hit KO moves to which this Pokémon is immune do not trigger this ability."
moxie,"This Pokémon's Attack rises one stage upon knocking out another Pokémon, even a friendly Pokémon.  This ability does not take effect when the Pokémon indirectly causes another Pokémon to faint, e.g. through poison or spikes.  If this Pokémon knocks out a Pokémon with mummy, the former's ability will change without taking effect."
shed-skin,"After each turn, this Pokémon has a 33% of being cured of any major status ailment."

filter,This Pokémon takes 0.75× as much damage from moves that are super effective against it.  This ability functions identically to solid rock.
pickpocket,"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, if it does not have a held item, it steals the attacker's held item.  This Pokémon cannot steal upon being knocked out.  It can steal if the attacker has a substitute, but cannot steal when its own Substitute is hit.  If a move hits multiple times, only the last hit triggers this ability.  If this Pokémon is wild, it cannot steal from a trained Pokémon."
steadfast,"Whenever this Pokémon flinches, its Speed rises one stage."
aftermath,"When this Pokémon is knocked out by a move that makes contact, the move's user takes 1/4 its maximum HP in damage."
prism-armor,"Super-effective damage this Pokémon takes is reduced to 0.75×.  This Ability is not bypassed by mold breaker, teravolt, or turboblaze."

merciless,This Pokémon's moves critical hit against poisoned targets.
inner-focus,This Pokémon cannot flinch.
serene-grace,"This Pokémon's moves have twice their usual effect chance.  An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect.  For example, flamethrower's chance of burning the target is doubled, but protect's chance of success and air cutter's increased critical hit rate are unaffected.  secret power is unaffected."
perish-body,"When hit by a move that makes direct contact, the Pokémon and the attacker will faint after three turns unless they switch out of battle."
refrigerate,Turns the bearer's normal-type moves into ice-type moves.  Moves changed by this ability have 1.3× their power.
keen-eye,"This Pokémon cannot have its accuracy lowered.  This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped."
cute-charm,"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being infatuated.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any wild Pokémon whose species can be either gender has a 2/3 chance of being set to the opposite gender, and a 1/3 chance of having a random gender as usual."
rough-skin,"Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user takes 1/8 of its maximum HP in damage.  This ability functions identically to iron barbs."

blaze,"When this Pokémon has 1/3 or less of its HP remaining, its fire-type moves inflict 1.5× as much regular damage."
unaware,"This Pokémon ignores other Pokémon's stat modifiers for the purposes of damage and accuracy calculation.  Effectively, this affects modifiers of every stat except Speed.  The power of punishment and stored power is calculated as usual.  When this Pokémon hurts itself in confusion, its stat modifiers affect damage as usual."
clear-body,"This Pokémon cannot have its stats lowered by other Pokémon.  This ability does not prevent any stat losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Speed cut from paralysis.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative stat modifiers through guard swap, heart swap, or power swap.  This ability functions identically to white smoke in battle."
plus,"This Pokémon has 1.5× its Special Attack if any friendly Pokémon has plus or minus.  This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.  If either ability is disabled by gastro acid, both lose their effect."
magma-armor,"This Pokémon cannot be frozen.  If a Pokémon is frozen and acquires this ability, it will immediately thaw out; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.  Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its hatch counter decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each step cycle, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.  This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or flame body."

intimidate,"When this Pokémon enters battle, the opponent's Attack is lowered by one stage.  In a double battle, both opponents are affected.  This ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle.  This ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute.  Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped."
klutz,"In battle, this Pokémon cannot use its held item, nor will the item have any passive effect on the battle, positive or negative.  This Pokémon also cannot use fling.  The Speed cut from the iron ball and the effort items (the macho brace, power weight, power bracer, power belt, power lens, power band, and power anklet) is unaffected.  Items that do not directly affect the battle, such as the exp share, the amulet coin, or the soothe bell, work as usual.  All held items work as usual out of battle.  Other moves that use the held item, such as natural gift and switcheroo, work as usual."
beast-boost,Raises this Pokémon's highest stat by one stage when it faints another Pokémon.
compound-eyes,"This Pokémon's moves have 1.3× their accuracy.  This ability has no effect on the one-hit KO moves (fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold).

big-pecks,This Pokémon's Defense cannot be lowered by other Pokémon.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative Defense modifiers through heart swap or guard swap.
lightning-rod,"All other Pokémon's single-target electric-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.  If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.  If the Pokémon is a ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost."
magic-guard,"This Pokémon is immune to damage not directly caused by a move.  For example, this Pokémon takes no damage from from weather, recoil, status ailments, or spikes, but it still suffers from the Attack cut when burned, and a life orb will still power up this Pokémon's moves without damaging it.  Anything that directly depends on such damage will also not happen; for example, leech seed will neither hurt this Pokémon nor heal the opponent, and Pokémon with a jaboca berry or rowap berry will not consume the berry when hit by this Pokémon.  The following are unaffected: struggle, pain split (whether used by or against this Pokémon), belly drum, substitute, curse, moves that knock the user out, and damage from confusion.  This Pokémon will neither lose nor regain HP if it drains HP from a Pokémon with liquid ooze.  If this Pokémon is badly poisoned, the poison counter is still increased each turn; if the Pokémon loses this ability, it will begin taking as much damage as it would be if it had been taking increasing damage each turn."
cursed-body,Moves that hit this Pokémon have a 30% chance of being Disabled afterward.
corrosion,This Pokémon's moves and item ignore the usual immunity of Poison and Steel Pokémon when attempting to inflict poison.
harvest,"After each turn, if the last item this Pokémon consumed was a Berry and it is not currently holding an item, it has a 50% chance of regaining that Berry, or a 100% chance during strong sunlight."
truant,"Every second turn on which this Pokémon should attempt to use a move, it will instead do nothing (""loaf around"").  Loafing around interrupts moves that take multiple turns the same way paralysis, flinching, etc do.  Most such moves, for example bide or rollout, are simply cut off upon loafing around.  Attacks with a recharge turn, such as hyper beam, do not have to recharge; attacks with a preparation turn, such as fly, do not end up being used.  Moves that are forced over multiple turns and keep going through failure, such as outrage, uproar, or any move forced by encore, keep going as usual.  If this Pokémon is confused, its confusion is not checked when loafing around; the Pokémon cannot hurt itself, and its confusion does not end or come closer to ending.  If this Pokémon attempts to move but fails, e.g. because of paralysis or gravity, it still counts as having moved and will loaf around the next turn.  If it does not attempt to move, e.g. because it is asleep or frozen, whatever it would have done will be postponed until its next attempt; that is, it will either loaf around or move as usual, depending on what it last did.  This ability cannot be changed with worry seed, but it can be disabled with gastro acid, changed with role play, or traded away with skill swap."
intrepid-sword,Boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat when the Pokémon enters a battle.
disguise,"If this Pokémon is in its Disguised Form and takes damage from a move, it switches to its Busted Form and the damage is prevented.  Other effects are not prevented.  This ability cannot be copied or replaced.  This ability only takes effect for Mimikyu."
cotton-down,"When the Pokémon is hit by an attack, it scatters cotton fluff around and lowers the Speed stat of all Pokémon except itself."
sand-force,"During a sandstorm, this Pokémon's rock-, ground-, and steel-type moves have 1.3× their base power.  This Pokémon does not take sandstorm damage, regardless of type."

light-metal,This Pokémon has half the usual weight for its species.
bad-dreams,Opposing Pokémon take 1/8 of their maximum HP in damage after each turn while they are asleep.
trace,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it copies a random opponent's ability.  This ability cannot copy flower gift, forecast, illusion, imposter, multitype, trace, wonder guard, or zen mode."
frisk,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals an opposing Pokémon's held item to all participating trainers.  In a double battle, if one opponent has an item, this Pokémon will Frisk that Pokémon; if both have an item, it will Frisk one at random."
rivalry,"This Pokémon inflicts 1.25× as much regular damage against Pokémon of the same gender and 0.75× as much regular damage against Pokémon of the opposite gender.  If either Pokémon is genderless, damage is unaffected."
scrappy,This Pokémon ignores ghost-type Pokémon's immunity to normal- and fighting-type moves.  Ghost Pokémon's other types affect damage as usual.
cheek-pouch,"Restores HP upon eating a Berry, in addition to the Berry's effect."
quick-feet,"Whenever this Pokémon has a major status ailment, it has 1.5× its Speed.  This Pokémon is not affected by the usual Speed cut from paralysis.  Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved."

misty-surge,"When this Pokémon enters battle, it changes the terrain to misty terrain."
victory-star,"All friendly Pokémon's moves, including this Pokémon's own moves, have 1.1× their usual accuracy while this Pokémon is in battle."
multitype,"If this Pokémon is holding an elemental Plate, its type and form change to match the Plate.  This Pokémon's held item, whether or not it is a Plate, cannot be taken by covet or thief, nor removed by knock off, nor traded by switcheroo or trick.  Covet, Thief, and Knock Off still inflict damage against this Pokémon.  Unlike with sticky hold, this Pokémon cannot use fling, Switcheroo, or Trick to lose its item itself, nor gain an item through Switcheroo or Trick if it does not have one.  This ability has no effect for any Pokémon other than arceus.  This ability cannot be traded with skill swap, nor copied with role play or trace, nor disabled with gastro acid, nor changed with worry seed.  This Pokémon cannot use Skill Swap or Role Play to lose its ability itself.  mold breaker cannot ignore this ability.  If a Pokémon Transforms into an Arceus with this ability, it will Transform into Arceus's default, normal-type form.  If the Transforming Pokémon is holding a Plate, this ability will then activate and change the Pokémon into the corresponding form."
anger-point,"Whenever this Pokémon receives a critical hit, its Attack rises to the maximum of 6 stages.  This ability will still take effect if the critical hit is received by a substitute."
pressure,"Moves targetting this Pokémon use one extra PP.  This ability stacks if multiple targets have it.  This ability still affects moves that fail or miss.  This ability does not affect ally moves that target either the entire field or just its side, nor this Pokémon's self-targetted moves; it does, however, affect single-targetted ally moves aimed at this Pokémon, ally moves that target all other Pokémon, and opponents' moves that target the entire field.  If this ability raises a move's PP cost above its remaining PP, it will use all remaining PP.  When this Pokémon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.

This does not work on Pokémon received outside of battle or roaming legendaries."

If an ability could either hinder or help this Pokémon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  Abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  For example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  This ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  This ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  An ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  For example, this Pokémon's moves can paralyze a Pokémon with limber, but Limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this Pokémon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.
