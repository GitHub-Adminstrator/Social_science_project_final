substitute,"Transfers 1/4 the user's max HP into a doll that absorbs damage and causes most negative move effects to fail.  If the user leaves the field, the doll will vanish.  If the user cannot pay the HP cost, this move will fail.  The doll takes damage as normal, using the user's stats and types, and will break when its HP reaches zero.  Self-inflicted damage from confusion or recoil is not absorbed.  Healing effects from opponents ignore the doll and heal the user as normal.  Moves that work based on the user's HP still do so; the doll's HP does not influence any move.  The doll will block major status effects, confusion, and flinching.  The effects of smelling salts and wake up slap do not trigger against a doll, even if the Pokémon behind the doll has the appropriate major status effect.  Multi-turn trapping moves like wrap will hit the doll for their regular damage, but the multi-turn trapping and damage effects will not activate.  Moves blocked or damage absorbed by the doll do not count as hitting the user or inflicting damage for any effects that respond to such, e.g., avalanche, counter, or a rowap berry.  magic coat still works as normal, even against moves the doll would block.  Opposing Pokémon that damage the doll with a leech move like absorb are healed as normal.

A Pokémon affected by yawn before summoning the doll will still fall to sleep.  The doll blocks intimidate, but all other abilities act as though the doll did not exist.  If the user has an ability that absorbs moves of a certain type for HP (such as volt absorb absorbing thunder wave), such moves will not be blocked.  life orb and berries that cause confusion still work as normal, but their respective HP loss and confusion are absorbed/blocked by the doll.  The user is still vulnerable to damage inflicted when entering or leaving the field, such as by pursuit or spikes; however, the doll will block the poison effect of toxic spikes.  The doll is passed on by baton pass.  It keeps its existing HP, but uses the replacement Pokémon's stats and types for damage calculation.  All other effects work as normal."
perish-song,"Every Pokémon is given a counter that starts at 3 and decreases by 1 at the end of every turn, including this one.  When a Pokémon's counter reaches zero, that Pokémon faints.  A Pokémon that leaves the field will lose its counter; its replacement does not inherit the effect, and other Pokémon's counters remain.  This effect is passed on by baton pass.  This move cannot be copied by mirror move."
leech-seed,Plants a seed on the target that drains 1/8 of its max HP at the end of every turn and heals the user for the amount taken.  Has no effect on grass Pokémon.  The seed remains until the target leaves the field.  The user takes damage instead of being healed if the target has liquid ooze.  rapid spin will remove this effect.  This effect is passed on by baton pass.
heat-crash,"Inflicts regular damage.  The greater the user's weight compared to the target's, the higher power this move has, to a maximum of 120.  User's weight                    | Power -------------------------------- | ----: Up to 2× the target's weight     |    40 Up to 3× the target's weight     |    60 Up to 4× the target's weight     |    80 Up to 5× the target's weight     |   100 More than 5× the target's weight |   120 "

mimic,"This move is replaced by the target's last successfully used move, and its PP changes to 5.  If the target hasn't used a move since entering the field, if it tried to use a move this turn and failed, or if the user already knows the targeted move, this move will fail.  This effect vanishes when the user leaves the field.  If chatter, metronome, mimic, sketch, or struggle is selected, this move will fail.  This move cannot be copied by mirror move, nor selected by assist or metronome, nor forced by encore."

flying-press,"Inflicts regular damage.  For the purposes of type effectiveness, this move is both fighting- and flying-type: its final effectiveness is determined by multiplying the effectiveness of each type against each of the target's types.

hidden-power,"Inflicts regular damage.  Power and type are determined by the user's IVs.  Power is given by `x * 40 / 63 + 30`.  `x` is obtained by arranging bit 1 from the IV for each of Special Defense, Special Attack, Speed, Defense, Attack, and HP in that order.  (Bit 1 is 1 if the IV is of the form `4n + 2` or `4n + 3`.  `x` is then 64 * Special Defense IV bit 1, plus 32 * Special Attack IV bit 1, etc.)  Power is always between 30 and 70, inclusive.  Average power is 49.5.  Type is given by `y * 15 / 63`, where `y` is similar to `x` above, except constructed from bit 0.  (Bit 0 is 1 if the IV is odd.)  The result is looked up in the following table.  Value | Type ----: | --------     0 | fighting     1 | flying     2 | poison     3 | ground     4 | rock     5 | bug     6 | ghost     7 | steel     8 | fire     9 | water    10 | grass    11 | electric    12 | psychic    13 | ice    14 | dragon    15 | dark  This move thus cannot be normal.
